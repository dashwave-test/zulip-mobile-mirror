function demo_need_value_flow() {
  // A basic principle of how Flow works is that it's focused on tracking
  // the, well, *flow* (the name is not a coincidence) of values from one
  // place in the program (a variable, a function parameter, an object
  // property, an expression, etc.) to another.
  //
  // Type-level expressions are secondary to this.  Their implications often
  // only get worked through lazily, when some value-level flow makes it
  // necessary to do so.
  //
  // That means if you're testing some type-level operator like IsSupertype
  // or BoundedDiff, you'll typically need to create some value-level flows
  // to exercise it -- even for cases where the intent is that some choices
  // of type parameter result in an error of their own.

  // Here's a toy example of a generic type with an internal constraint:
  type IsString<S: string> = string;

  // IsString<T> should be an error for any T that isn't <: string.
  // And indeed it is, in a variety of contexts:

  //   $FlowExpectedError[incompatible-type-arg]
  function f1<T>(x: T): IsString<T> { return 'b'; }
  // while compare:
  function f2<T: string>(x: T): IsString<'a'> { return 'b'; }
  function f3<T: string>(x: T): IsString<'a'> { return x; }

  //   $FlowExpectedError[incompatible-type-arg]
  (x: string): IsString<number> => x;
  //   $FlowExpectedError[incompatible-type-arg]
  (x: string): IsString<mixed> => x;
  // while compare:
  (x: string): IsString<string> => x;
  (x: string): IsString<'a'> => x;
  (x: string): IsString<empty> => x;

  //   $FlowExpectedError[incompatible-type-arg]
  (x: IsString<mixed>): string => x;
  // while compare:
  (x: IsString<string>): string => x;

  //   $FlowExpectedError[incompatible-type-arg]
  ('b': IsString<mixed>);
  // while compare:
  ('b': IsString<string>);

  //
  //
  // However.  One thing those all have in common is that the offending
  // instantiation `IsString<…>` appears as either the source or the
  // destination of some value-level flow.

  // For example, this return type had a returned value flowing into it:
  //   $FlowExpectedError[incompatible-type-arg]
  (x: string): IsString<number> => x;

  // If we have the same bogus `IsString<…>` type as a return type, but
  // avoid ever returning a value that has to flow to that return type,
  // then there's no error:
  (x: string): IsString<number> => { throw new Error(); };

  // In the other direction, this parameter with a bogus type was the source
  // of a flow into the return value:
  //   $FlowExpectedError[incompatible-type-arg]
  (x: IsString<mixed>): string => x;
  // We could flow it into somewhere else instead, and still get the error:
  //   $FlowExpectedError[incompatible-type-arg]
  (x: IsString<mixed>): string => { (x: string); return 'b'; };
  // But if it flows nowhere at all, there's no error:
  (x: IsString<mixed>): string => { x; return 'b'; };
  (x: IsString<mixed>): string => 'b';

  // Similarly if we just mention the bogus type in another way but with no
  // value-level flows to or from it, there's no error:
  declare var x: IsString<number>;

  //
  //
  // Happily this point isn't really a warning -- there's no need to worry
  // about getting anything wrong by forgetting it.  As long as you set out
  // to write tests for the error case, if you forget this point then you'll
  // see that your tests are failing to fail.
  //
  // Rather, this is a tip for how to solve that problem if you run into it:
  // cause some value to flow to or from the bogus type, and then Flow
  // should notice that the type is bogus.
}

/** A subtler tip on writing tests for fancy generic types like these. */
function demo_short_circuits() {
  // As seen above, in order to test one of these types you need to exercise
  // it with some value-level flow to or from it.
  //
  // A further wrinkle is that if your value-level flow is necessarily OK
  // thanks to some general rule of the type system, some reasoning that
  // doesn't depend on the details of the bogus type (that you're trying to
  // test is indeed seen as bogus)… then Flow may apply that rule and
  // short-circuit any closer inspection of the specific types on each side.
  //
  // In particular (and we'll demo each of these below):
  //  * If the flow is from `empty`, it succeeds.  (Even if the other end is
  //    an internally-bogus type.)
  //  * If the flow is to `mixed`, it succeeds.  (Ditto.)
  //  * If the flow is from some type to itself, it succeeds (even if that
  //    type is internally bogus.)
  //
  // (The jargon for these facts is: `empty` is a "bottom" type; `mixed` is
  // a "top" type; and the subtype relation (the ability to flow from one
  // type to another) is "reflexive".)
  //
  // It seems bad that Flow can accept a program, with no errors, when it
  // contains a type somewhere that's bogus like `IsString<number>`.
  // Ideally Flow would reject those, because it's confusing.  (One likely
  // reason it accepts them is for performance: each of these situations is
  // quick to check for, and then Flow gets to check off that flow as valid
  // and move on.)
  //
  // But from Flow's perspective this is a fundamentally sound thing to do,
  // because it can't enable something actually going wrong in the program
  // at runtime.  That is, if some place in the program (some expression,
  // variable, object property, etc.) gets a bogus type, and if at runtime
  // that place actually gets reached so that there's some actual value that
  // supposedly has that bogus type, then (modulo some other issue in Flow)
  // it must be because of a type error somewhere in the program.
  //
  // In particular, if one of the rules above prevents an error we would
  // have otherwise gotten about a bogus type, and a value ever actually
  // reaches that bogus type at runtime, then there must be an error
  // somewhere else too:
  //  * The `empty` type, as the name suggests, has no values.  So if
  //    something with a bogus type gets a value at runtime through a flow
  //    from `empty`, then there must have been a type error along the way
  //    to get the value into the `empty`-typed spot in the first place.
  //  * A flow from a bogus type to `mixed` leads only from, not to, a bogus
  //    type.
  //  * If some point A with a bogus type T gets a value at runtime through
  //    a flow from some other point B with the same bogus type T, then the
  //    value must have already before then gotten into point B, with its
  //    bogus type T.
  //
  // For the `empty` case in particular, here's a more theoretical way of
  // putting it that may be helpful.  The type `empty` is the type
  // interpretation of logical falsity: if you have an expression of type
  // `empty`, then reaching that expression at runtime means asserting
  // falsehood.  And "ex falso quodlibet": from falsehood, anything follows.

  //
  //
  // Here's the same toy example from before.
  type IsString<S: string> = string;
  // IsString<T> should be an error for any T that isn't <: string.

  // Here we flow something into a bogus IsString<T>, and get an error:
  //   $FlowExpectedError[incompatible-type-arg]
  (x: string): IsString<number> => x;
  // But if the source of the flow is `empty`, there's no error:
  (x: empty): IsString<number> => x;

  // Similarly, a flow somewhere from a bogus IsString<T> is an error:
  //   $FlowExpectedError[incompatible-type-arg]
  (x: IsString<number>): string => x;
  // but not if that somewhere is `mixed`:
  (x: IsString<number>): mixed => x;

  // Nor is flowing from the bogus type to itself an error:
  (x: IsString<number>): IsString<number> => x;

  // So if we want to test that `IsString<number>` is bogus as expected,
  // the solution is to flow from some type that isn't itself or `empty`:
  //   $FlowExpectedError[incompatible-type-arg]
  (x: string): IsString<number> => x;
  // or to flow to some type that isn't itself or `mixed`:
  //   $FlowExpectedError[incompatible-type-arg]
  (x: IsString<number>): string => x;

  //
  //
  // But what if the type already is no higher than `empty`?
  type IsString2<S: string> = empty;
  // If we flow from a type that isn't `empty`, the flow itself will be an
  // error.

  // Well, as one solution, we can flow *from* it instead:
  //   $FlowExpectedError[incompatible-type-arg]
  (x: IsString2<number>): string => x;

  // Alternatively, we can still flow to it from some non-empty type:
  //   $FlowExpectedError[incompatible-type-arg]
  //   $FlowExpectedError[incompatible-return]
  (x: string): IsString2<number> => x;
  // It'll come with an additional suppression for the flow itself.
  // But that one will have an error code like `incompatible-return` or
  // `incompatible-cast`.  The error in the type arguments passed to the
  // generic will have the distinctive error code `incompatible-type-arg`.
  // So the FlowExpectedError with that code checks for the error we're
  // trying to test for.

  //
  //
  // Happily, like the previous demo, this is not really a warning -- you
  // don't need to worry about it in advance, because if you run into it
  // you'll be alerted by your tests failing to find the expected errors.
  //
  // If you do, avoid flowing from `empty` or to `mixed` (or from the type
  // to itself.)  Instead, find a less extreme type to use for the other end
  // of the flow.

function demo_variance_short_circuit() {
  // In addition to the perfectly sound short circuits above, Flow has
  // another:
  //  * If the flow is between two instances of the same generic type,
  //    and that type has variance markings and the appropriate flows
  //    between the respective type arguments succeed, then the overall flow
  //    succeeds.  (The example below may make this clearer.)
  //
  // This would be OK so long as when the lower type (the source of the
  // flow) in this situation is valid, that would imply the upper type (the
  // sink of the flow) is as well.  If that were true, then:
  //  * If the upper type is bogus, then the lower type is bogus too.  So if
  //    the upper type gets a value at runtime through this flow, then there
  //    was already a value in the bogus lower type.
  //
  // Awkwardly, that does not seem to be true.

  // Define variations on our toy example above, now where the generic type
  // is covariant or contravariant.
  type IsStringCovar<+S: string> = string;
  type IsStringContra<-S: string> = string;
  // The `+` just means that IsStringCovar<S> <: IsStringCovar<T> whenever
  // S <: T.  (When we make the definition, Flow checks this is actually
  // true: which it is, because `string <: string` in any event.)
  //
  // Conversely, the `-` just means that IsStringContra<S> <: IsStringContra<T>
  // whenever T <: S (note the swapping of sides).
  //
  // And now that we've declared those facts about these type aliases, and
  // Flow has checked them, Flow is prepared to use them freely.

  // Here's a flow between two equally-bogus IsStringCovar<…> types.
  // That's fine in itself.
  (x: IsStringCovar<3>): IsStringCovar<number> => x;

  // But here's a flow from a valid IsStringCovar<…> to an invalid one.
  // Flow still accepts it.
  (x: IsStringCovar<string>): IsStringCovar<number | string> => x;

  // And here's some perfectly runnable code, with a bogus IsStringCovar<…>
  // on an expression that actually gets a value at runtime.
  {
    const f = (x: IsStringCovar<string>): IsStringCovar<number | string> => x;
    f('a');
    // That expression has type IsStringCovar<number | string>.
    // Which is not a valid type, because IsStringCovar has a `string` bound
    // on its type parameter.

    // We can even have the value of bogus type get actually used:
    console.log(String(f('a')));
    // There's no `any` there -- flowlib has on `class String`:
    //   static (value:mixed):string;
    // so it takes a `mixed` and that's perfectly legit.
    //
    // The flows here, up to the argument to `String`, are
    //  'a' -> IsStringCovar<string> -> IsStringCovar<number | string> -> mixed
    // and the first is just fine; the second is accepted because variance;
    // and the third is accepted because of the `mixed` short circuit
    // described in `demo_short_circuits` above.

    // It's doubtful to exactly call that an unsoundness, because
    // IsStringCovar is such a toy example that the constraint in it doesn't
    // really matter.  But it's a bit of a warning sign for sticking bounds
    // in generic definitions and counting on those to always be observed,
    // certainly when the constraints don't manifest in any more "real" way.
    //
    // Fortunately this issue is avoidable as long as when we choose to put
    // a variance annotation on a generic type's parameters, we check the
    // annotation's validity for ourselves.  See below.
  }

  // Here's the same demo using a variation of the `IsSupertype` alias we
  // actually use in our code.
  type BadIsSupertype<+S, +T: S> = S;
  // (The real `IsSupertype` has `+S, -T: S`.  That makes it harmless just
  // like `IsStringContra`, as below.  See also test_IsSupertype_variance.)
  {
    const f = (x: BadIsSupertype<string, string>): BadIsSupertype<string, number | string> => x;
    const y: BadIsSupertype<string, number | string> = f('a');
    console.log(String(f('a')));

    // TODO try to construct a more-real demo, using BadIsSupertype
  }

  // On the other hand `IsStringContra` is harmless.  We can make a flow
  // that Flow accepts *from* an invalid IsStringContra<…> to a valid one:
  (x: IsStringContra<number | string>): IsStringContra<string> => x;

  // But if the source of the flow is a valid IsStringContra<…>, then any
  // flow Flow would accept on account of the variance rule is one where the
  // sink is also valid.  For example this is rejected:
  //   $FlowExpectedError[incompatible-return]
  (x: IsStringContra<string>): IsStringContra<number | string> => x;

  // That's because for Flow to accept `IsStringContra<S> <: IsStringContra<T>`
  // on account of the variance of `IsStringContra`, we must have `T <: S`
  // (where the direction is swapped); that's what the `-S` in the definition
  // means.
  //
  // And on the other hand if `IsStringContra<S>` is valid, then `S <: string`.
  //
  // So if both of those are true, then `T <: S <: string`, so `T <: string`
  // and `IsStringContra<T>` is valid too.

  // In short, if the constraint `S: string` was satisfied and you
  // *increase* `S`, then it can stop being satisfied, so a generic type
  // definition with `+S: string` causes Flow to accept flows from a valid
  // type to an invalid one.  But if you *decrease* `S`, then the constraint
  // remains satisfied; so a flow that gets accepted because of the variance
  // of a parameter `-S: string` can go from a valid type only to another
  // valid type.

  // Two possible views of what the Flow bug is here (and they're not
  // mutually exclusive; arguably it's two bugs) are:
  //
  //  * It shouldn't short-circuit here (and maybe not in some of the other
  //    cases above, in `demo_short_circuit`); it should detect when a
  //    type-expression violates a generic type's stated bounds, even when
  //    just evaluating a flow that the variance says is OK.
  //
  //  * It shouldn't have accepted our definition of `IsStringCovar`,
  //    because increasing `S` can cause the constraint `S: string` to stop
  //    being satisfied.  OTOH `IsStringContra` is fine, because decreasing
  //    `S` always preserves the constraint.
  //
  // If it enforced either of those rules, there'd be no issue.  So to avoid
  // this bug, it suffices for us to manually enforce either one of them.
  //
  // The first one applies anywhere we use the generic type, which is
  // potentially a lot of places and so is hard to systematically make a
  // practice of.  But the second one only applies when *writing* a generic
  // type alias, and in particular one that makes fancy use of bounds.  That
  // isn't something we write very often, so watching for this there is
  // fairly tractable.
  //
  // So to avoid this bug, what that comes down to is that it suffices to
  // not write a definition like `IsStringCovar`.  This means: when adding
  // variance annotations +/- to the type parameters of a generic type
  // alias, we should watch the constraints and enforce that the stated
  // variance doesn't break them.
