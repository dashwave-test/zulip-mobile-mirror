# Joining the alpha channel

If you're actively developing the app, you should join the [alpha
channel](release.md#terminology) so that when we make an alpha release
you get it on your normal devices you use daily.  This means you'll see any
regressions we have, so you can help find and fix them before they go out
wider. :-)

(If you'd like to help but aren't closely following development each day,
please [join the beta][join-beta]!  And then give feedback and report
issues, either in the repo or in chat.  The beta is nearly as fresh as the
alpha but somewhat more stable.)

* **Android**: A maintainer will add you to the list, and then give
  you a link you'll use to confirm.  (Maintainer: see [Release >
  Testing > Internal testing > Testers][play-internal-testers] in the
  Play Console.)

* **iOS**: A maintainer will send you an invite to join App Store Connect.
  Then after you join, there's a second step to join the list of users that
  get alpha updates. (Maintainer: that list is confusingly labeled in the UI
  as simply ["App Store Connect Users"][] -- don't be fooled.  Confirm the
  person is on it; if not, see the plus-sign icon next to the "Testers"
  heading, which lets you send an invite for that step.)
