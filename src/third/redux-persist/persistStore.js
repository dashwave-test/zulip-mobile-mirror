        // storage. That's because:
        //
        // (a) The state in memory was empty before `REHYDRATE`
        //     fired. There wasn't anything interesting there that
        //     was merged with `REHYDRATE`'s payload. And,
        //
        // (b) The `REHYDRATE` payload itself came straight (via
        //     our reviver) from what was saved to storage. It
        //     would only have changed if at least one migration
        //     had run, and it hasn't. In this conditional, we
        //     know that it hasn't because the previous version
        //     (in redux-persist-migrate's terms) is the same as
        //     the current version.
        //
        // Part of the work for preventing the save is already
        // done: `.pause()` is called on `persistor` above, and
        // `.resume()` is called after. This does mean that
        // persisting `REHYDRATE`'s payload isn't triggered
        // directly on `REHYDRATE`. However, it is triggered on a
        // *subsequent* action, because, upon each action, the
        // persistor compares a piece of `lastState` to the
        // corresponding piece of `state` to check whether that
        // piece needs to be persisted -- and, on an action just
        // after `REHYDRATE`, `lastState` is stale, containing the
        // pre-`REHYDRATE` state. That's because `lastState`
        // doesn't naturally update when the persistor is paused.
        //
        // So, fix that by still resetting `lastState` with the
        // result of `REHYDRATE` when the persistor is paused; we
        // can do that because we've exposed `_resetLastWrittenState` on
        // the persistor.

      // As mentioned in a comment above, the current strategy of using
      // `.pause()` and `.resume()` means that the time at which the
      // `REHYDRATE` payload is persisted (if we've asked it to be
      // persisted; i.e., if a migration has been done) is not during
      // the processing of `REHYDRATE` itself, but rather during the
      // processing of the action that immediately follows it. Rather
      // than postponing the important task of persisting a migration's
      // results until some arbitrary next action fired somewhere in the
      // app, fire a next action right here, right now.
